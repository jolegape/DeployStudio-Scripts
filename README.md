# DeployStudio Scripts
------------
A collection of scripts I am currently using in my workplace. 

The following changes will need to be made to suit your environment:
- File paths in any scripts
- Preferred computer description format
- Add/remove steps in the post install script.
- Change Munki enrolment URL / settings

As with any code on the internet, don't blindly copy and paste / run what you download without reading it first. These scripts work for me, but may not for you. I am not responsible for any side effects of using these scripts, but am more than happy to help where I can.

The following scripts are provided:
1. Enroll system with Munki ([Munki_Enroll.sh](https://github.com/jolegape/DeployStudio-Scripts/blob/master/Munki_Enroll.sh "Munki_Enroll.sh"))
2. Post Install Tasks ([Post_Install.sh](https://github.com/jolegape/DeployStudio-Scripts/blob/master/Post_Install.sh "Post_Install.sh"))
3. Set computer description in Active Directory ([Set_ComputerDescription_AD.sh](https://github.com/jolegape/DeployStudio-Scripts/blob/master/Set_ComputerDescription_AD.sh "Set_ComputerDescription_AD.sh"))
